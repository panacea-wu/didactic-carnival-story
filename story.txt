Background: Once upon a time, a traveller has come to this ancient kingdom. He
did not have impressive strength or magic to show. But instead, he brought 
technology people had never seen before to this land...

He wishes he could build his own kingdom by using his advanced technology. In order
to achieve his goal, he claims that he is the strongest man in the world,and no one
can defeat him. To prove his strength, he buid his own armor and challenged the most 
famous knight in the kingdom - Sauron.

The fight between Sauron and the traveller was intense. Traveller was indeed
skilled; however, not as skilled as Sauron. The traveller fought well against
Sauron, but eventually Sauron managed to overpower him, and disarmed him.
Being disarmed, the traveller was left to the mercy of the crowd. Crowd 
screamed "Death!" and Sauron tried to pierce the traveller's heart with his
sword, but to everyone's surprise, Sauron's sword did not pierce the 
traveller's armor. The entire crowd was at surprise. The traveller got up and
grabbed his sword. Sauron took a couple steps back, he was clearly terrified.
Traveller swung his sword and slashed Sauron's neck. He was now victorious.
 
Everyone was confused on why the traveller managed to survive Sauron's 
execution and turn the tables. At this moment, the traveller ripped his 
shirt apart and revealed a shiny piece of armor under his shirt. He told 
everyone that this armor was made from a very precious type of metal called
the vibranium. This exclusive material can only be found in his hometown, a 
kingdom far far away by the name of Wakanda. The people finally realized how 
strong this traveller was and gave him a nickname called the Black Panther.
The Black Panther rose to the throne and became the king of the kingdom.
